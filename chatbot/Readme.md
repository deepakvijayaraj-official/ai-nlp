### Bank Chatbot using AI

This is a sample advanced chatbot program in Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library for a virtual bank assistant in India.
It involves integrating features specific to banking and financial services, such as account balance inquiries, fund transfers, and currency conversion. 

Additionally, it should handle user authentication securely. 

Replace the simulation code with actual banking logic and user authentication methods to make it functional in a real banking environment.

You need to have associated packages installed as a Pre-requisite.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 bank_chatop.py
```
